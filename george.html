	George Sr. mourned his son's death in giving money away.</br>
	The son maybe dead, but his memory would be kept alive. </br>
	The now childless, bereft man didn't need to leave anything behind. The memory of his son would become his legacy.</br></br>
	
	He gave money to universities.</br> 
	One where his son actually went to. In Harvard they built the freshmen residency in his name.</br>
	The other half was given to Northwestern. </br>
	They named the entire campus that is now known as the Chicago Campus after the dead son.</br>
	</br>
	George Sr. lost all his money in the great depression. Or at least he lost enough in order to ask for the donation back. </br>
	He asked only from Northwestern. Or at least only there he actually got anything back. Harvard didn't mention any request. </br>
	</br>
	When the university returned the money, they also returned his name.</br>
	He gave the money in order to keep the memory alive. Now both the memory is gone from there and the gates are dead.
