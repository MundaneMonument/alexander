		I always saw ghosts as the opposite of beautiful shells. They are what is on the inside and always moved by the worst of our emotions.
		 They are up for revenge, fear, grief and the like. 
		 They induce fear because of their ability to show us our own inside, to show us just how bad our inside can seem.</br>
		 That was until i heard about him.</br> 
		 I could not reach him, or i did not want to reach him. He has been through enough after his death already, but i still wanted to know more about him. 
		 So I decided to ask the first person to see his beauty after his death.</br>
		I asked her what made her fall in love with him. What made her also leave him.</br>
		She saw him after ten years of his terminal event for the <a href="medium.html">first time.</a> 
		He was beautiful, elegant, smart and more interesting than anyone of the chicago young people that she had met. 
		When he was alive he was a useless pencil pusher that was just a son of someone that made better time for himself.</br> 
		She said that without his flesh to slow him down, one could see that he was pure, he really was just a beautiful boy that was tied to a bumbling body. She loved him at first sight, because he reminded her of how beautiful people can be underneath it all. He was eager for some recognition.  
		When i was talking to her about him, he was already far from her mind. 
		It has been a long time since her relationship with him. She still held him dearly, they split up on good terms.</br> 
		Everywhere it was mentioned that she grew tired of the relationship. 
		If you are wondering about that, she wants to let you know that she finds it offensive.</br> 
		He was the sweetest man, even if he was a man no longer. 
		We live in a time of sapiosexuality, and yet you want to say that she was bored to be attached to a ghost without a body? </br></br>

		No, the reason that they broke up was because he felt that he was tied for this world for too long. 
		This place has gave him nothing. He wanted to live it for the ghosts that prefer to be seen as fearful. 
		He took the statement of “Too beautiful to live” to an even more extreme extent - he was too beautiful to be dead. </br>
		She showed me her old ring. A platinum band with a tarnished silver inlay. 
		She held on to the ring even after their relationship ended. 
		It was a good time in my life and it ended on a good note. Our relationship was nice and shaped me. 
		I strongly believe that  my exes are a part of my life even if we are now no longer together. 
		He shaped the woman i was and the ghost i am today so why should i forget about him. 
		He made me see that i can be beautiful underneath. </br></br>

		I asked about her mother-in-law, and she said that she was a good woman that was bereft.
		She wanted to know everything about her son, but she had a better version of him in her head than he had of real life.</br> 
		Her mother-in-law didn't want to hear about their relationship problems, how he tried to push Muriel away. 
 		How he had a problem understanding privacy issues, which in hindsight is very understandable, he was bodiless and she now knows how it feels like.</br> 
		I asked her about <a href="marionFlorida.html">Marion</a>, her mother-in-law, move to florida after her husband's death.</br>
		She said that she understands the need to run away from failed memories and a town full of ghosts. 
		She also understands why the place that she moved to was full of ghosts.
