		After her <a href="george.html">husband</a>'s death Marion decided to leave this town. 
		All it had for her was memories and ghosts. </br>
		She decided to go to Florida. She has been the president and founder of the Garden Society since 1929.</br>
		She said "It might not be better, but at least I can grow a garden the whole year"</br></br>
		
		She moved to the house that she and George Sr. built together, <a href="Alejandro.html">Casa Alejandro</a>. A small estate among the mansion of the Oil Swell Crowd.</br>
		The place is said to be haunted to this day. Most places think it is the ghost of her son </br>
		I tend to think they are wrong. 
		Alexander did not haunt anything until then, why should he start haunting a place that didn't even exist when he was alive? </br</br>
		
		I think it is haunted by everyone but her son. Maybe by all the youth that were (according to the Tribune) just as brave and bright as he.
		Maybe it is haunted by unkept promises. </br>
		For in a way there isn't much of a difference between an unkept promise and a ghost.
		They both can't effect the world directly, but both are able to change it when they are believed.
